## Overview
The NCAA conducts 90 championships annually across three divisions and over twenty sports. To enhance and celebrate the student-athletes’ experience, as well as offset the cost of the championships, the NCAA actively markets and sells tickets to the events. As part of the marketing efforts, the NCAA maintains a list of past and potential customers.

### Objectives
- **Predict Ticket Purchases:** Use customer data to predict whether a customer will purchase a ticket.
- **Market Identification:** Determine if the ticket will be purchased on the primary or secondary market.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises Division I Women’s Basketball customer data coupled with target labels for creating predictive models. It includes a wealth of information about the customer, and we have integrated external data to improve the predictive power of our models.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Exploration
- Understanding the structure of the dataset.
- Visualizing key characteristics and trends in the data.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Creating new features from existing data.
- Integrating external data to enhance predictive power.

### 3. Model Building
We tried multiple models and evaluated their performance:
- **`Random Forest`**
- **`Neural Network`**
- **`Gradient Boosting`:** Selected as the final model due to its higher performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparing the performance of different models to select the best one.

### 5. Visualization
Using `Tableau` to communicate the results of our predictive models, illustrating key characteristics and trends in the data to justify the effectiveness of our approach.

## Results
- **Final Model:** Gradient Boosting, chosen for its superior performance.
- **Visualization:** Detailed Tableau visualization showcasing the model results and key insights.
